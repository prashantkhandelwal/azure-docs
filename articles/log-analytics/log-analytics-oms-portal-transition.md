# OMS portal moving to Azure
One piece of feedback heard repeatedly from Log Analytics customers is the need for a single user experience to monitor and manage both on-premises and Azure workloads. You probably know the Azure portal is the hub for all Azure services and offers a rich management experience with capabilities such as dashboards for pinning resources, intelligent search for finding resources, and tagging for resource management. To consolidate and streamline the monitoring and management workflow, we started adding the OMS portal capabilities into the Azure portal. We are happy to announce most of the features of the OMS portal are now part of the Azure portal. In fact, some of the new features such as Traffic Analytics are only available in the Azure portal. There are only a few gaps remaining including a few solutions that are still in the process to be moved to Azure portal. If you are not using these features, you will be able to accomplish everything you were doing in the OMS portal with the Azure portal and more. If you havenâ€™t already done so, we recommend you start using the Azure portal today! 

We expect to close down the remaining gaps between the two portals by August 2018. Based on feedback from customers, we will communicate the timeline for sunsetting the OMS portal. We are excited to move to the Azure portal and expect the transition to be easy. But we understand changes are difficult and can be disruptive. Send any questions, feedback, or concerns to **LAUpgradeFeedback@microsoft.com**. The rest of this article goes over the key scenarios, the current gaps, and the roadmap for this transition. 

## Progress
Following are updates that have been completed since previous versions of this article.

### July 27

- [DNS Analytics](log-analytics-dns.md) is now fully functional in the Azure portal.
- [Update Management](../automation/automation-update-management.md) has been updated to be fully functional in the Azure portal. See [Migrate your OMS Update Deployments to Azure](../automation/migrate-oms-update-deployments.md) for details.
- [Alerts](#changes-to-alerts) have now been fully extended into the Azure portal.
- [Custom logs preview feature](log-analytics-data-sources-custom-logs.md) is now automatically enabled for all workspaces.

## What will change? 
The following changes are being announced with the deprecation of the OMS portal. Each of these changes is described in more detail in the sections below.

- You will be able to create new workspaces only in the Azure portal.
- The new alert management experience will replace the Alert Management solution.
- User access management will be done in the Azure portal using Azure role-based access control.
- The Application Insights Connector is no longer required since the same functionality can be enabled through cross-workspace queries.
- The OMS Mobile App will be deprecated. 
- The NSG solution is being replaced with enhanced functionality available via Traffic Analytics solution.
- New connections from System Center Operations Manager to Log Analytics require updated management packs.


## Current known gaps 
There are currently some functionality gaps that require you to still use the OMS Portal. These gaps are being closed, and this document will be updated appropriately. You should also refer to [Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=log-analytics) for on-going announcements about extensions and changes.

- The following solutions are not yet fully functional in the Azure portal. You should continue to use these solutions in the classic portal until they're updated.

    - Windows Analytics Solutions ([Upgrade Readiness](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/deploy/upgrade-readiness-get-started), [Device Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/device-health-monitor), and [Update Compliance](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/update-compliance-get-started))
    - [Surface Hub](log-analytics-surface-hubs.md)

-  To access Log Analytics resource in Azure, the user must be granted access through [Azure role-based access](#user-access-and-role-migration).


## What should I do now?  
You should refer to [Common questions for transition from OMS portal to Azure portal for Log Analytics users](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-portal-faq.md) for information about how to transition to the Azure portal. If the [gaps described above](#current-known-gaps) don't apply to your environment, then you should consider starting using Azure portal as your primary experience. Send any feedback, questions, or concerns to LAUpgradeFeedback@microsoft.com.

## New workspaces
Starting July 29, you will no longer be able to create new workspaces using the OMS portal. Follow the guidance in [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](log-analytics-quick-create-workspace.md) to create a new workspace in the Azure portal.

## Changes to alerts 

### Alert extension  

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts have now been fully extended into the Azure portal. Existing alert rules can be viewed in the OMS portal, but they can only be managed in the Azure portal.

Alerts are in the process of being [extended into the Azure portal](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-alerts-extend.md). Once this is complete, management actions on alerts will only be available in Azure portal. Existing alerts will continue to be listed in the OMS portal. If you access alerts programmatically by using the Log Analytics Alert REST API or Log Analytics Alert Resource Template, you'll need to use action groups instead of actions in your API calls, Azure Resource Manager templates, and PowerShell commands.

### Alert management solution
Instead of the [alert management solution](log-analytics-solution-alert-management.md), you can use [Azure Monitor's unified alerting interface](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-unified-alerts.md) to visualize and manage your alerts. This new experience aggregates alerts from multiple sources within Azure including log alerts from Log Analytics. You can see distributions of your alerts, take advantage of automated grouping of related alerts via smart groups, and view alerts across multiple subscriptions while applying rich filters. All these features are available in preview starting June 4, 2018. The alert management solution will not be available in the Azure portal. 

The data collected by the Alert Management solution (records with a type of Alert) continues to be in Log Analytics as long as the solution is installed for the workspace. Starting August 2018, streaming of alerts from unified alerting into workspaces will be enabled, replacing this capability. Some schema changes are expected and will be announced at a later date.

## User access and role migration
Azure portal access management is richer and more powerful than the access management in the OMS Portal, but it does require some conversions. See [Manage workspaces](log-analytics-manage-access.md#manage-accounts-and-users) for details of access management in Log Analytics.

Starting July 30, automatic conversion of the access control permissions from the OMS portal to Azure portal permissions will start. Once the conversion is completed, the OMS Portal user management section will route users to Access control (IAM) in Azure. 

During the conversion, the system will check each user or security group that has permissions in the OMS portal and determine if it has same level or permissions in Azure. If permissions are missing, it will assign the following roles for the relevant workspaces and solutions.

| OMS portal permission | Azure Role |
|:---|:---|
| ReadOnly | Log Analytics Reader |
| Contributor | Log Analytics Contributor |
| Administrator | Owner |

To make sure that no excessive permissions are assigned to users, the system will not automatically assign these permissions on the resource group level. As a result, workspace administrators must manually assign themselves _owner_ or _contributor_ roles at resource group or subscription level to perform the following actions.

- Add or remove solutions
- Define new custom views
- Manage alerts 

In some cases, the automatic conversion cannot apply permission and will prompt the administrator to manually assign permissions.

## OMS Mobile App
The OMS mobile app will be sunsetted along with the OMS portal. Instead of the OMS mobile app, to access information about your IT infrastructure, dashboards and saved queries, you can access the Azure portal directly from your browser in your mobile device. To get alerts, you should configure [Azure Action Groups](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-action-groups.md) to receive notifications in the form of SMS or a voice call

## Application Insights Connector and solution
[Application Insights Connector](log-analytics-app-insights-connector.md) provides a way to bring Application Insights data into a Log Analytics workspace. This data duplication was required to enable visibility across infrastructure and application data.

With the support of [cross-resource queries](log-analytics-cross-workspace-search.md), there is no longer this need to duplicate data. As such, the existing Application Insights solution will be deprecated. Starting July, you will not be able to link new Application Insights resources to Log Analytics workspaces. Existing links and dashboards will continue to function until November 2018.


## Azure Network Security Group Analytics
The [Azure Network Security Group Analytics solution](log-analytics-azure-networking-analytics.md#azure-network-security-group-analytics-solution-in-log-analytics) will be replaced with the recently launched [Traffic Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/traffic-analytics-in-preview/) which provides visibility into user and application activity on cloud networks. Traffic Analytics helps you audit your organization's network activity, secure applications and data, optimize workload performance and stay compliant. 

This solution analyzes NSG Flow logs and provides insights into the following.

- Traffic flows across your networks between Azure and Internet, public cloud regions, VNETs, and subnets.
- Applications and protocols on your network, without the need for sniffers or dedicated flow collection appliances.
- Top talkers, chatty applications, VM conversations in the cloud, traffic hotspots.
- Sources and destinations of traffic across VNETs, inter-relationships between critical business services and applications.
- Security including malicious traffic, ports open to the Internet, applications or VMs attempting Internet access.
- Capacity utilization, which helps you eliminate issues of over provisioning or underutilization.

You can continue to rely on Diagnostics Settings to send NSG logs to Log Analytics so your existing saved searches, alerts, dashboards will continue to work. Customers who have already installed the solution can continue to use it until further notice. Starting August 15, the Network Security Group Analytics solution will be removed from the marketplace and made available through the community as a [Azure QuickStart Template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Operationalinsights).

## System Center Operations Manager
If you've [connected your Operations Manager management group to Log Analytics](log-analytics-om-agents.md), then it will continue to work with no changes. For new connections though, you must follow the guidance in [Microsoft System Center Operations Manager Management Pack to configure Operations Management Suite](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/momteam/2018/07/25/microsoft-system-center-operations-manager-management-pack-to-configure-operations-management-suite/).
