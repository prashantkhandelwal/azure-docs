# How to sign up and upload your first video

This short getting started tutorial shows how to sign in to Video Indexer and how to upload your first video.

> [!Note]
> When creating a Video Indexer account, you can choose a free trial account (where you get a certain number of free indexing minutes) or a paid option (where you are not limited by the quota). <br/>With free trial, Video Indexer provides up to 600 minutes of free indexing to website users and up to 2400 minutes of free indexing to API users. <br/>With paid option, you create a Video Indexer account that is [connected to your Azure subscription and a Azure Media Services account](connect-to-azure.md). You pay for minutes indexed as well as the Media Account related charges. 

## Sign up and sign in

To start developing with Video Indexer, you must first Sign up and sign in to the [Video Indexer](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/) portal. 
 	 
For more information, see [Start using APIs](video-indexer-use-apis.md).

## Upload a video using the Video Indexer portal

Once Video Indexer is done analyzing, you will get a notification with a link to your video and a short description of what was found in your video. For example: people, topics, OCRs.
