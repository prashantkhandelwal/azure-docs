# Quickstart: Recognize speech in C# under .NET Core on Windows using the Speech SDK

[!include[Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create a C# console application for .NET Core on Windows using the Cognitive Services Speech SDK to transcribe speech to text.
The application is built with the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK NuGet Package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform .NET platform implementing the [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard) specification.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](get-started.md).
* A Windows PC with a working microphone.
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Community Edition or higher.
* The **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload in Visual Studio. You can enable it in **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features**.

## Create a Visual Studio project

1. In Visual Studio 2017, create a new Visual C# .NET Core Console App. In the **New Project** dialog box, from the left pane, expand **Installed** \> **Visual C#** \> **.NET Core** and then select **Console App (.NET Core)**. For the project name, enter *helloworld*.

1. Install and reference the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget). In the Solution Explorer, right-click the solution and select **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.

1. In the upper-right corner, in the **Package Source** field, select **Nuget.org**. Search for and install the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` package and install it into the **helloworld** project.

1. Accept the license in the dialog that appears.

## Add the sample code

1. Open `Program.cs` in your Visual Studio project and replace all the code in this file with the following.

    [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/csharp-dotnetcore-windows/helloworld/Program.cs#code)]

1. Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Save changes to the project.

## Build and run the sample

1. Build the application. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Start the application. From the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

1. A console window appears, prompting you to say something (in English). The recognized text then appears in the same window.
