# Configure a VMSS Managed Service Identity using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to perform the Managed Service Identity operations on a Azure virtual machine scale set, using PowerShell:
- Enable and disable the system assigned identity on a virtual machine scale set
- Add and remove a user assigned identity on a virtual machine scale set

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with Managed Service Identity, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system assigned and user assigned identity](overview.md#how-does-it-work)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- To perform the management operations in this article, your account needs the following role assignments:
    - [Virtual Machine Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) to create a virtual machine scale set and enable and remove system assigned managed and/or user identity from a virtual machine scale set.
    - [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role to create a user assigned identity.
    - [Managed Identity Operator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) role to assign and remove a user assigned identity from and to a virtual machine scale set.
- Install [the latest version of Azure PowerShell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM) if you haven't already. 

## System assigned managed identity

In this section, you learn how to enable and remove a system assigned identity using Azure PowerShell.

### Enable system assigned identity during the creation of an Azure virtual machine scale set

To create a VMSS with the system assigned identity enabled:

1. Refer to *Example 1* in the [New-AzureRmVmssConfig](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvmssconfig) cmdlet reference article to create a VMSS with a system assigned identity.  Add the parameter `-IdentityType SystemAssigned` to the `New-AzureRmVmssConfig` cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    $VMSS = New-AzureRmVmssConfig -Location $Loc -SkuCapacity 2 -SkuName "Standard_A0" -UpgradePolicyMode "Automatic" -NetworkInterfaceConfiguration $NetCfg -IdentityType SystemAssigned`
    ```

2. (Optional) Add the Managed Service Identity VMSS extension using the `-Name` and `-Type` parameter on the [Add-AzureRmVmssExtension](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/add-azurermvmssextension) cmdlet. You can pass either "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows" or "ManagedIdentityExtensionForLinux", depending on the type of virtual machine scale set, and name it using the `-Name` parameter. The `-Settings` parameter specifies the port used by the OAuth token endpoint for token acquisition:

    > [!NOTE]
    > This step is optional as you can use the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) identity endpoint, to retrieve tokens as well.

   ```powershell
   $setting = @{ "port" = 50342 }
   $vmss = Get-AzureRmVmss
   Add-AzureRmVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -Name "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows" -Type "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows" -Publisher "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.0" -Setting $settings 
   ```

## Enable system assigned identity on an existing Azure virtual machine scale set

If you need to enable a system assigned identity on an existing Azure virtual machine scale set:

1. Sign in to Azure using `Login-AzureRmAccount`. Use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription that contains the virtual machine scale set. Also make sure your account belongs to a role that gives you write permissions on the virtual machine scale set, such as “Virtual Machine Contributor”:

   ```powershell
   Login-AzureRmAccount
   ```

2. First retrieve the virtual machine scale set properties using the [`Get-AzureRmVmss`](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/get-azurermvmss) cmdlet. Then to enable a system assigned identity, use the `-IdentityType` switch on the [Update-AzureRmVmss](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/update-azurermvmss) cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name -myVmss -IdentityType "SystemAssigned"
   ```

3. Add the Managed Service Identity VMSS extension using the `-Name` and `-Type` parameter on the [Add-AzureRmVmssExtension](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/add-azurermvmssextension) cmdlet. You can pass either "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows" or "ManagedIdentityExtensionForLinux", depending on the type of virtual machine scale set, and name it using the `-Name` parameter. The `-Settings` parameter specifies the port used by the OAuth token endpoint for token acquisition:

   ```powershell
   $setting = @{ "port" = 50342 }
   $vmss = Get-AzureRmVmss
   Add-AzureRmVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -Name "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows" -Type "ManagedIdentityExtensionForWindows" -Publisher "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.0" -Setting $settings 
   ```

### Disable the system assigned identity from an Azure virtual machine scale set

If you have a virtual machine scale set that no longer needs the system assigned identity but still needs user assigned identities, use the following cmdlet:

1. Sign in to Azure using `Login-AzureRmAccount`. Use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription that contains the VM. Also make sure your account belongs to a role that gives you write permissions on the virtual machine scale set, such as “Virtual Machine Contributor”:

2. Run the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVmss -IdentityType "UserAssigned"
   ```

If you have a virtual machine scale set that no longer needs system assigned identity and it has no user assigned identities, use the following commands:

```powershell
Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVmss -IdentityType None
```

## User assigned identity

In this section, you learn how to add and remove a user assigned identity from a virtual machine scale set using Azure PowerShell.

### Assign a user assigned identity during creation of an Azure virtual machine scale set

Creating a new virtual machine scale set with a user assigned identity isn't currently supported via PowerShell. See the next section on how to add a user assigned identity to an existing virtual machine scale set. Check back for updates.

### Assign a user identity to an existing Azure virtual machine scale set

To assign a user assigned identity to an existing Azure virtual machine scale set:

1. Sign in to Azure using `Connect-AzureRmAccount`. Use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription that contains the virtual machine scale set. Also make sure your account belongs to a role that gives you write permissions on the virtual machine scale set, such as “Virtual Machine Contributor”:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureRmAccount
   ```

2. First retrieve the virtual machine scale set properties using the `Get-AzureRmVM` cmdlet. Then to assign a user assigned identity to the virtual machine scale set, use the `-IdentityType` and `-IdentityID` switch on the [Update-AzureRmVmss](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/update-azurermvmss) cmdlet. Replace `<VM NAME>`, `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>`, `<RESROURCE GROUP>`, `<USER ASSIGNED ID1>`, `USER ASSIGNED ID2` with your own values.

   [!INCLUDE[ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

   ```powershell
   Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP> -Name <VMSS NAME> -IdentityType UserAssigned -IdentityID "<USER ASSIGNED ID1>","<USER ASSIGNED ID2>"
   ```

### Remove a user assigned managed identity from an Azure virtual machine scale set

If your virtual machine scale set has multiple user assigned identities, you can remove all but the last one using the following commands. Be sure to replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<VMSS NAME>` parameter values with your own values. The `<MSI NAME>` is the user assigned identity's name property, which should remain on the virtual machine scale set. This information can be found in the identity section of the virtual machine scale set using `az vmss show`:

```powershell
Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVmss -IdentityType UserAssigned -IdentityID "<MSI NAME>"
```
If your virtual machine scale set does not have a system assigned identity and you want to remove all user assigned identities from it, use the following command:

```powershell
Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVmss -IdentityType None
```
If your virtual machine scale set has both system assigned and user assigned identities, you can remove all the user assigned identities by switching to use only system assigned.

```powershell 
Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVmss -IdentityType "SystemAssigned"
```
